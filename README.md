###Interactive Guide: Google for Startups Cloud Program
##üöÄ 1. Overview
This project is a single-page, interactive web application designed to provide a comprehensive and easily digestible guide to the Google for Startups Cloud Program.

The goal of this application is to transform the complex, text-heavy information about the program into an intuitive, visual, and exploratory experience. It is specifically tailored for a startup founder or executive who needs to quickly understand the program's benefits, eligibility tiers, and strategic value. Instead of reading a static report, the user can interact directly with the data to compare options and plan their application strategy.

##‚ú® 2. Key Features
Interactive Tier Selector: Users can switch between the "Start," "Scale," and "AI-First" tiers to dynamically update charts and information cards, allowing for instant and clear comparison of benefits.

Dynamic Data Visualizations: Utilizes Chart.js to create:

A Bar Chart that visually compares the maximum cloud credit value for each program tier.

A Donut Chart that breaks down the total value of the premier AI-First package, showing that the benefits extend beyond just cloud credits.

Benefits Deep Dive: Presents the core value propositions (Financial, Technical, Growth, Ecosystem) in an easy-to-scan card format, accompanied by icons for quick recognition.

Actionable Application Guide: Features an interactive checklist for application prerequisites. Users can click items to mark them as complete, turning a passive list into a practical tool.

Strategic Startup Roadmap: A visual timeline illustrates the startup's journey through the program, from pre-funding to growth and optimization, framing the program as a long-term partnership.

Fully Responsive Design: The application is built with a mobile-first approach and is accessible and easy to use on any device, from a large desktop monitor to a smartphone.
